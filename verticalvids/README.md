1. Inspect the file... what is familiar to you, what is **not** familiar
1. Change the ugly green color of the `<h1>` tags with internal CSS styles
1. Add a 4th column - Mr. M. will show you.    **TIP**: Bootstrap has a **12** column grid
1. Add an `alert` box from https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/alerts/
1. Using **FontAwesome**  add your icons. Ref: https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&m=free

1. Add your own image, make it responsive in the 2nd column
1. Add 3 Bootstrap components from https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/
1. Add 2 more nice icons from FontAwesome https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&m=free
1. Add a *responsive* YouTube video to any column.  **Ref:**: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/utilities/embed/
1. Save a copy of `index.html` to your Google Drive - or anywhere in the **Cloud** - or just email it to yourself.
1. Show Mr. M. your work **before** you go.

> Notes
- Mr. M. discourages the use of USB drive in Programming Courses for many reasons
- Mr. M. doesn't user Blackboard for submission of assignments etc.  (too old, too slow, too expensive, not a tool you'll ever use again)
